# RecipePuppy

This is my first project as a Flatiron School of Engineering student. I created a command line interface application in Ruby that pulls data from an API of recipes, and asks the user which recipe they would like to see ingredients for. The app shows the ingredients, instructions, and title for each recipe.  


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'recipe_puppy'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install recipe_puppy

## Usage

To start the program, enter ./bin/executable into the command line. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
